            <h3>Web Developer and Material Scientist</h3>
            <p>You might saw me smile very less but that's not what defines me appropiately. I am a jovial person with a
                great passion of book reading. Although my institutional education gives you a glimpse of a material
                scientist, But I am a full-time web developer. Specially front-end but I can handle full stack with
                satisfaction. My family is my top most priority. I love to live with fullfillment.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>I already learn the basic HTML and CSS. I can even handle git and github. Splendid!! Right? Actually, I
                learned all of this within 3 days. You need to have a great desire to learn all of this. Once you find
                your passion in it, I would suggest jump in immediately. It's better late than never. Stay blessed!!</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
